            <h2>1.INTRODUCTION</h2>
            <p>What is Python?<br>
                Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.<br>
                Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code.<br>
                
                Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.<br>
                
                It is used for:<br>
                
                web development (server-side),<br>
                software development,<br>
                mathematics,<br>
                system scripting.<br>
                What can Python do?<br>
                Python can be used on a server to create web applications.<br>
                Python can be used alongside software to create workflows.<br>
                Python can connect to database systems. It can also read and modify files.<br>
                Python can be used to handle big data and perform complex mathematics.<br>
                Python can be used for rapid prototyping, or for production-ready software development.<br>
                Python Syntax compared to other programming languages<br>
                Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.<br>
                Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.<br>
                Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.<br>

            <h2>2.VARIABLES</h2>
            <p>In Python, variables are used to store data that can be manipulated or referenced in a program. They are like containers that hold values. Here's how you can work with variables in Python:<br>
                1. Variable Naming*: <br>
                   - Variables must start with a letter or an underscore (_) and can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.<br>
                   - They are case-sensitive (my_variable is different from My_Variable).<br>
                2. Assignment:<br>
                   - You assign a value to a variable using the = operator. For example: x = 5 assigns the value 5 to the variable x.<br>
                3. Data Types:<br>
                   - Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. It's inferred based on the value you assign.<br>
                   - Common data types include integers (int), floating-point numbers (float), strings (str), lists (list), dictionaries (dict), etc.<br>
                4. Example:<br>
                   python<br>
                   x = 5         # x is an integer<br>
                  y = 2.5       # y is a float<br>
                   name = "John" # name is a string<br>
                5. Reassignment:<br>
                   - You can change the value of a variable by assigning it a new value.
                   python<br>
                   x = 5<br>
                   x = 7  # Now x contains the value 7<br>
                6. Multiple Assignments:<br>
                   - You can assign multiple variables at once.<br>
                   python<br>
                   a, b, c = 1, 2, 3  # a=1, b=2, c=3<br>
                7. Constants:<br>
                   - Conventionally, constants are written in ALL_CAPS to indicate that their value should not be changed.<br>
                8. Scope:<br>
                   - The scope of a variable determines where it can be accessed in the code. Variables can have global or local scope.<br>
                9. Printing Variables:<br>
                   - You can print the value of a variable using the print() function.<br>
                   python<br>
                   x = 5<br>
                   print(x)  # This will print 5<br>
                   10. *Dynamic Typing*:<br>
                    - You can change the type of a variable by assigning a value of a different type to it. For example, you can go from an integer to a string.<br>
                    python<br>
                    x = 5<br>
                    x = "hello"  # Now x is a string<br>
                    
                
                Remember, choosing meaningful variable names can greatly improve the readability and maintainability of your code.<br>

            <h2>3.PYTHON DATATYPES</h2>
            <p>Python data types are the categories of values that Python can store and manipulate. They determine what kind of operations can be performed on the data and how much memory it occupies.<br> Python has several built-in data types, such as:<br>

                - Numeric types:<br>
                 These include int, float, and complex classes that represent integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers respectively. <br>
                 For example, x = 42 is an integer, y = 3.14 is a floating-point number, and z = 2 + 5j is a complex number.<br>
                - Sequence types:<br>
                 These include str, list, tuple, and range classes that represent ordered collections of items. <br>
                 For example, s = "Hello" is a string, l = [1, 2, 3] is a list, t = (4, 5, 6) is a tuple, and r = range(10) is a range object.<br>
                - Mapping type: <br>
                This includes the dict class that represents an unordered collection of key-value pairs.<br>
                 For example, d = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25} is a dictionary.<br>
                - Set types: <br>
                These include the set and frozenset classes that represent unordered collections of unique items.<br>
                 For example, s = {"red", "green", "blue"} is a set, and f = frozenset({"a", "b", "c"}) is a frozenset.<br>
                - Boolean type:<br>
                 This includes the bool class that represents logical values of either True or False. <br>
                 For example, b = True is a boolean value.<br>
                - Binary types:<br>
                 These include the bytes, bytearray, and memoryview classes that represent sequences of bytes or byte-like objects.<br>
                  For example, b = b"Hello" is a bytes object, a = bytearray(5) is a bytearray object, and m = memoryview(b"World") is a memoryview object.<br>
                - None type: <br>
                This includes the special value None that represents the absence of any value.<br>
                 For example, n = None is a None value.<br>
                
                You can use the built-in function type() to check the data type of any object in Python. <br>
                For example, type(x) will return <class 'int'> if x is an integer.<br>

                           y = 5<br>
                           is_equal = x == y<br>
                           is_not_equal = x != y<br>
                           is_greater_than = x > y<br>
                           is_less_than = x < y<br>
                           is_greater_than_or_equal = x >= y<br>
                           is_less_than_or_equal = x <= y<br>
                        3. Logical Operations:<br>
                           - Logical AND (and)<br>
                           - Logical OR (or)<br>
                           - Logical NOT (not)<br>
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           a = True<br>
                           b = False<br>
                           logical_and = a and b<br>
                           logical_or = a or b<br>
                           logical_not_a = not a <br>
                        4. Bitwise Operations:<br>
                           - Bitwise AND (&)<br>
                           - Bitwise AND (&)<br>
                           - Bitwise XOR (^)<br>

                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 5<br>
                           y = 3<br>
                           bitwise_and = x & y<br>
                           bitwise_or = x | y<br>
                           bitwise_xor = x ^ y<br>
                           bitwise_not_x = ~x<br>
                           left_shift = x << y<br>
                           right_shift = x >> y<br>
                        5. Assignment Operations:<br>
                           - These combine an operation with assignment. For example, x += 1 is equivalent to x = x + 1.<br>
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 5<br>
                           x += 2  # Equivalent to x = x + 2<br>
                        6. Identity Operations:<br>
                           - is: Tests for object identity (whether two variables refer to the same object).<br>
                           - is not: Tests for negated object identity.<br>
                          Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = [1, 2, 3]<br>
                           y = [1, 2, 3]<br>
                         is_same_object = x is y  # False, x and y are different objects<br>
                         is_not_same_object = x is not y  # True, x and y are different objects<br>
                           
                        
                        7. Membership Operations:<br>
                          - in: Checks if a value is present in a sequence (e.g., a list).<br>
                           - not in: Checks if a value is not present in a sequence.<br>
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           my_list = [1, 2, 3]<br>
                           is_in_list = 2 in my_list  # True, 2 is in the list<br>
                           is_not_in_list = 4 not in my_list  # True, 4 is not in the list<br>
                        These are some of the fundamental operations in Python. They are used extensively in programming to perform a wide range of tasks. If you have specific operations or scenarios in mind, feel free to ask!<br>

            <h2>5.conditional statements</h2>
            <p>Conditional statements in Python allow you to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions. The main types of conditional statements are if, elif (short for "else if"), and else.<br>

                        Here's how they work:<br>
                        
                        1. If Statement:<br>
                           python<br>
                           if condition:<br>

                               print("x is greater than 5")<br>
                        2. If-Else Statement:<br>
                           python<br>
                           if condition:<br>

                               # Code to execute if condition is False<br>
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 3<br>
                           if x > 5:<br>
                               print("x is greater than 5")<br>
                           else:<br>
                               print("x is not greater than 5")<br>
                        3. If-Elif-Else Statement:<br>
                           python<br>
                           if condition1:<br>
                               # Code to execute if condition1 is True<br>
                           elif condition2:<br>
                               # Code to execute if condition2 is True<br>
                           else:<br>
                               # Code to execute if all conditions are False<br>
                         Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 3<br>
                           if x > 5:<br>
                               print("x is greater than 5")<br>
                           elif x == 5:<br>
                               print("x is equal to 5")<br>
                           else:<br>
                               print("x is less than 5")<br>
                           You can have multiple elif blocks to check for different conditions.<br>
                        4. Nested Conditional Statements:<br>
                           You can have conditional statements inside other conditional statements.<br>
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 10<br>
                           if x > 5:<br>
                               if x == 10:<br>
                                   print("x is 10")<br>
                               else:<br>
                                   print("x is greater than 5 but not equal to 10")<br>
                           else:<br>
                               print("x is not greater than 5")<br>
                        5. Ternary Conditional Operator:<br>
                           Python supports a one-line if-else expression. <br>  
                           Example:<br>
                           python<br>
                           x = 10<br>
                           message = "x is greater than 5" if x > 5 else "x is not greater than 5"<br>
                           print(message)<br>
                        These conditional statements are crucial for controlling the flow of a program based on different conditions. They allow your program to make decisions dynamically at runtime.<br>

            <h2>6.looping concept</h2>
            <p>
                        Looping in Python allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops in Python: for loops and while loops.<br>

1. For Loop:<br>
   - The for loop iterates over a sequence (e.g., a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects.<br>

   python<br>
   for variable in sequence:<br>
       # Code to execute for each item in the sequence<br>
   Example:<br>
   python<br>
   for i in range(5):<br>
       print(i)<br>
2. While Loop:<br>
   - The while loop repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is True.<br>
   python<br>
   while condition:<br>
       # Code to execute as long as the condition is True<br>
   Example:<br>
   python<br>
   x = 0<br>
   while x < 5:<br>
       print(x)<br>
       x += 1<br>
   Be careful with while loops, as they can lead to infinite loops if the condition never becomes False.<br>
3. Loop Control Statements:<br>
   - *Break*: Terminates the loop and transfers control to the statement immediately after the loop.<br>
   - *Continue*: Skips the rest of the current iteration and goes to the next iteration of the loop.<br>
   - *Pass*: Acts as a placeholder and does nothing. It's used when a statement is syntactically required but you don't want any code to execute.<br>
   Example:<br>
   python<br>
   for i in range(10):<br>
       if i == 3:<br>
           break<br>
       if i == 1:<br>
           continue<br>
       pass<br>
4. Looping through Lists:<br>
   - You can use a loop to iterate through the elements of a list.<br>
   Example:<br>
   python<br>
   my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]<br>
   for item in my_list:<br>
       print(item)<br>
5. Looping through Strings:<br>
   - Strings are iterable, so you can loop through the characters.<br>
   Example:<br>
   python<br>
   my_string = "hello"<br>
   for char in my_string:<br>
       print(char)<br>
6. Nested Loops:<br>
   - You can have loops inside other loops.
   Example:
   python
   for i in range(3):
       for j in range(3):
           print(i, j)
7. Looping with else:
   - The else block is executed when the loop completes without encountering a break.
   Example:
   python
   for i in range(5):
       print(i)
   else:
       print("Loop completed without a break")
   
These looping constructs are fundamental for automating repetitive tasks and processing collections of data. They allow you to efficiently handle situations where you need to perform a similar set of operations multiple times.

            <h2>7.control statement</h2>
            <p>
                    In Python, control statements are used to alter the flow of execution in a program. There are three main types of control statements:
                    1. Conditional Statements (if, elif, else): These allow you to execute different blocks of code depending on whether a certain condition is true or false.
                       Example:
                       python
                       x = 10
                       if x > 5:
                           print("x is greater than 5")
                       elif x == 5:
                           print("x is equal to 5")
                       else:
                           print("x is less than 5")
                    2. Loop Statements (for, while): These allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly.
                       Example using a for loop:
                       python
                       for i in range(5):
                           print(i)
                       Example using a while loop:
                       python
                       x = 0
                       while x < 5:
                           print(x)
                           x += 1
                    3. Transfer Statements (break, continue, pass): These statements are used to change the default flow of execution.
                       - break: Terminates the loop it is in and transfers control to the next statement after the loop.
                       - continue: Skips the rest of the loop's code for the current iteration and starts the next iteration.
                       - pass: Acts as a placeholder and does nothing. It's used when a statement is syntactically needed but you want to do nothing.
                       Example with break:
                       python
                       for i in range(10):
                           if i == 3:
                               break
                           print(i)
                       Example with continue:
                       python
                       for i in range(5):
                           if i == 2:
                               continue
                           print(i)
                       Example with pass:
                       python
                       x = 10
                       if x > 5:
                           pass
                    These control statements are fundamental in writing programs that can make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently.

            <h2>8.python funtions</h2>
            <p>
                In Python, a function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task or set of tasks. Functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name, a pair of parentheses (), and a colon : to indicate the start of the function block. Here's a basic syntax for defining a function:
python
def function_name(parameters):
    # Code block for the function
    # ...
    return result
Let's break down the components:
- def: This is the keyword used to define a function.
- function_name: This is the identifier for the function. It should follow the same naming conventions as variables.
- parameters: These are values that can be passed into the function. They are optional, and you can have none, one, or multiple parameters.
- return: This keyword is used to specify the value that the function should return after it's executed. It's optional, and a function can return nothing (None) if you omit it.
Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:
python
def add_numbers(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result


To use this function, you would call it with arguments (values to be used as x and y):
python
sum_result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 8
Functions are crucial for writing modular and reusable code. They help in organizing code, making it more readable, and reducing redundancy.

            <h2>9.modules</h2>
            <p>
            In Python, a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py. 
Modules can define functions, classes, and variables that you can use in other Python files. They allow you to organize code logically into reusable files. 
Here's an example of how you might create and use a module:
Suppose you have a file named my_module.py with the following code:
python
# my_module.py
def greet(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
age = 30
Now, in another Python file, you can use this module like this:
python
import my_module
my_module.greet("Alice")  # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(my_module.age)      # Output: 30
Here's what's happening:
1. We import the my_module using the import keyword.
2. We can then use the functions and variables defined in my_module by using my_module.<name> syntax.
There are different ways to import modules:
- import module_name: This imports the entire module and you access its elements using module_name.element.
- from module_name import element_name: This imports only the specified element from the module. You can then use it directly without prefixing the module name.
- import module_name as alias: This imports the module with an alias, allowing you to use a shorter name for the module.
For example:
python
import my_module as mm
mm.greet("Bob")  # Output: Hello, Bob!
print(mm.age)    # Output: 30
Modules are a fundamental concept in Python and they play a crucial role in organizing code into manageable and reusable units.

            <h2>11.pandas</h2>
            <p>
                Pandas is a popular open-source Python library used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools, making it an essential tool for working with structured data. Here are some key features and concepts associated with Pandas:
1. Data Structures:
   - *Series:* A one-dimensional labeled array capable of holding any data type.
   - *DataFrame:* A two-dimensional labeled data structure with columns that can be of different types. It is similar to a spreadsheet or SQL table.
   python
   import pandas as pd
   # Creating a Series
   s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
   # Creating a DataFrame
   data = {'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
           'Age': [25, 30, 35]}
   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
2. Data Input/Output: Pandas supports reading and writing data in various formats such as CSV, Excel, SQL databases, and more.
   python
   # Reading from a CSV file
   df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
   # Writing to a CSV file
   df.to_csv('new_data.csv', index=False)
3. Indexing and Selection:
   - You can select and manipulate data in a DataFrame using labels or positions.
   - It supports both label-based indexing (df.loc) and integer-based indexing (df.iloc).
   python
   df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}, index=['x', 'y', 'z'])
   # Label-based selection
   print(df.loc['x', 'A'])  # Output: 1
   # Integer-based selection
   print(df.iloc[0, 1])     # Output: 4
4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Pandas provides tools for handling missing data, data transformation, and feature engineering.
   python
   # Handling missing values
   df.dropna()     # Remove rows with NaN values
   df.fillna(0)    # Replace NaN values with 0
5. Grouping and Aggregation:
   - You can group data based on a key and perform aggregate functions on those groups.
   python
   df = pd.DataFrame({'Category': ['A', 'B', 'A', 'B'],
                      'Value': [10, 20, 30, 40]})
   # Grouping by 'Category' and calculating the mean
   df.groupby('Category').mean()
6. Merging and Joining:
   - Pandas allows you to combine datasets by merging or joining them based on a common key.
   python
   df1 = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['K0', 'K1', 'K2', 'K3'], 'A': ['A0', 'A1', 'A2', 'A3']})
   df2 = pd.DataFrame({'key': ['K0', 'K1', 'K2', 'K3'], 'B': ['B0', 'B1', 'B2', 'B3']})
   # Merging based on the 'key' column
   result = pd.merge(df1, df2, on='key')
Pandas is widely used in data science, machine learning, and data analysis workflows. It provides powerful tools for data cleaning, exploration, transformation, and visualization, making it an essential library for working with structured data in Python.

            <h2>12.python exception handling</h2>
            <p>
            Exception handling in Python allows you to deal with unexpected errors or exceptional situations that might occur during the execution of a program. It prevents the program from crashing and provides a mechanism to gracefully handle errors. Here are the key components of exception handling in Python:
1. Try and Except Blocks:
   - The try block is used to enclose the code that might raise an exception.
   - The except block is where you handle the specific exception(s) that occurred.
   python
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       result = 10 / 0  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
   except ZeroDivisionError as e:
       # Handle the specific exception
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
2. Multiple Except Blocks:
   - You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions.
   python
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       result = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   except ValueError as ve:
       # Handle a ValueError (e.g., if the user entered a non-integer)
       print(f"Invalid input: {ve}")
   except ZeroDivisionError as ze:
       # Handle a ZeroDivisionError
       print(f"Error: {ze}")
3. Generic Except Block:
   - You can use a generic except block to catch any type of exception. However, it's generally recommended to be specific about the exceptions you catch.
   python
   try:
       # Code that might raise an exception
       result = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   except Exception as e:
       # Handle any type of exception
       print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
4. Else Block:
   - The else block is executed if no exceptions occur inside the try block.
   python
   try:
       result = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   except ValueError as ve:
       print(f"Invalid input: {ve}")
   else:
       print(f"You entered: {result}")
5. Finally Block:
   - The finally block is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. It's often used for cleanup tasks.
   python
   try:
       result = int(input("Enter a number: "))
   except ValueError as ve:
       print(f"Invalid input: {ve}")
   finally:
       print("Execution completed.")
6. Raising Exceptions:
   - You can manually raise an exception using the raise keyword.
   python
